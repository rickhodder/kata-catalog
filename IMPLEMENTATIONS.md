# Kata Implementations

A list of kata implementations, showing source code and/or video walkthrough URLs, broken down by language and kata.

In many cases it may be useful to see how a kata was performed, step by step. In addition to watching associated videos, you may be able to use a tool like [githistory.xyz](https://github.com/pomber/git-history) to see individual commits to a particular file in a repo. Here's an [example file showing how a service was updated as part of the Builder Pattern with Tests kata](https://github.githistory.xyz/ardalis/BuilderTestKataAttempts/blob/main/2021-06-11/src/BuilderTestSample/Services/OrderService.cs).

Use this template to add your own code and/or video walkthrough, in date order, most recent at the top:
